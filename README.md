# NeSt-VR 
This is a **fork of [ALVR v20.6.0](https://github.com/alvr-org/ALVR)**, a solution that enables streaming VR games over Wi-Fi.  The **UPF Wireless Networking Research Group** has extended ALVR by introducing several features designed for VR streaming performance monitoring and optimization. 

Our contributions include the implementation of a VR-tailored Adaptive BitRate (ABR) algorithm, called the **Network-aware Step-wise ABR algorithm (NeSt-VR)**, which optimizes streaming quality based on real-time network conditions:

This algorithm is implemented as a new bitrate mode in ALVR, named `Nest vr`:

</div>

Additionally, we have integrated **additional metrics** that characterize the network state during streaming, providing insights into video frame (VF) delivery and overall network performance. These metrics are logged in the `session_log.txt` file when the `Log to disk` setting is enabled, and are displayed in real time on the `Statistics` tab of the ALVR dashboard:

For a comprehensive validation of several metrics and a detailed introduction and evaluation of the NeSt-VR algorithm, please refer to our paper:  **["NeSt-VR: An Adaptive Bitrate Algorithm for Virtual Reality Streaming over Wi-Fi"]([https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15614](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14947))**.

## Added metrics overview 

> **Note:** Our client-side reported statistics —essential for obtaining the added metrics— are sent from the head-mounted diplay (HMD) to the server over TCP immediately after the client receives a VF. This feedback is received at the server significantly sooner than ALVR’s native statistics packet, which is delayed until the VF is ready
for display

### Time-related metrics
* **Client-side frame span** (`frame_span_ms` in `GraphNetworkStatistics`): time interval between the reception of the first packet to the reception of the last packet of a VF

* **Frame inter-arrival time** (`frame_interarrival_ms` in `GraphNetworkStatistics`): time interval between
the reception of the last packet of a VF and the last packet of the previous received VF

* **Video Frame Round-Trip Time (VF-RTT)** (`rtt_ms` in `GraphNetworkStatistics`): time it takes for a complete VF to travel from the server to the client and for our supplementary UL packet —promptly sent upon the complete reception of the VF— to reach the server

### Reliability metrics 
* **Packets lost** (`shards_lost` in `GraphNetworkStatistics`): number of packets lost in the interval between two VF receptions

* **Packets duplicated** (`shards_duplicated` in `GraphNetworkStatistics`): number of packets duplicated in the interval between two VF receptions

* **Frames skipped** (`frames_skipped` in `GraphNetworkStatistics`): number of VFs lost prior to decoding, i.e., after network transmission due to packet losses or significant delays

* **Frames dropped** (`frames_dropped` in `GraphStatistics`): number of decoded VFs lost before visualization

### Data rate metrics 
* **Instantaneous video network throughput** (`instant_network_throughput_bps` in `GraphNetworkStatistics`): rate at which video data is received by the client, measured in the interval between two VFs receptions

* **Peak network throughput** (`peak_network_throughput_bps` in `GraphNetworkStatistics`): ratio between the VF’s size and its client-side frame span. It serves as a discrete estimate of network bandwidth since ALVR sends each VF in a single burst
### Network Stability metrics
* **VF jitter** (`frame_jitter_ms` in `GraphNetworkStatistics`): variation in VF time deliveries, computed as the sample standard deviation of frame inter-arrival times 

* **Video packet jitter** (`interarrival_jitter_ms` in `GraphNetworkStatistics`): variability in video packet arrival times as defined in [RFC 3550](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3550)

* **Filtered one-way delay gradient** and **One-way delay gradient** (`filtered_ow_delay_ms` and `ow_delay_ms`, respectively, in `GraphNetworkStatistics`) : rate of change in one-way delay (OWD) between two consecutive VFs, smoothed using a Kalman filter
as described in ["Analysis and design of the google congestion control for web real-time communication (WebRTC)"](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/2910017.2910605) and a state noise variance of $10^{−7}$

## NeSt-VR overview

NeSt-VR operates every $\tau$ seconds, progressively adjusting the target bitrate ($B_k \in \mathcal{B}$) —initially set to $B_{init}$ Mbps— in discrete steps of size $\Delta B$ to avoid significant video quality shifts that may disrupt the user’s QoE. The set of available target bitrates ($\mathcal{B}$) depends on the configured minimum bitrate ($B_{\min}$), maximum bitrate ($B_{\max}$), and the number of steps between them ($N_{\text{s}}\in \mathbb{Z}^+$).

At each adjustment period $k\in \mathbb{Z}^+$, occurring at time $T=k\cdot\tau$, NeSt-VR computes the average Network Frame Ratio (NFR) and average VF-RTT —averaged over either a sliding window of $n$ samples, a sliding window of $t$ seconds ($t$ defaults to $\tau$), or an exponentially weighted moving average (EWMA) with weight $\omega$— and applies a hierarchical decision-making process:

* If the average NFR is below its threshold $\rho$, the target bitrate is reduced in $N_{\text{dw}}\in \mathbb{Z}^+$ steps
* If both the average NFR and average VF-RTT surpass their thresholds ($\rho$ and $\sigma$, respectively), with a probability of $\gamma_{\text{rtt}}$, the bitrate is reduced in $N_{\text{dw}}\in \mathbb{Z}^+$ steps; otherwise, it remains consistent
* If the average NFR exceeds $\rho$ and the average VF-RTT is below its threshold $\sigma$, with probability $\gamma_{\text{+}}$, the bitrate is increased in $N_{\text{up}}\in \mathbb{Z}^+$ steps; otherwise, it remains consistent
* Finally, to ensure the bitrate does not exceed the network’s capacity, the target bitrate is upper-bounded by $m \cdot C_{\text{NeSt-VR}}$, with $m \leq 1$. Here, $C_{\text{NeSt-VR}}$ denotes NeSt-VR’s estimated network capacity, computed as the average of the peak network throughput

> **Note:** NFR is computed as $fps_{rx} / fps_{tx}$, where $fps_{rx}$ denotes the frame delivery rate and $fps_{tx}$ denotes the frame transmission rate

> **Note:** $\gamma_{\text{rtt}}$ moderates the frequency of bitrate reductions in response to a high average VF-RTTs, particularly when frame delivery rates are acceptable, thereby giving greater weight to NFR over VF-RTT in bitrate adaptation decisions

> **Note:** $\gamma_{\text{+}}$ serves as an exploration parameter to assess whether higher bitrates can be sustained without compromising the user’s QoE

NeSt-VR configurable parameters are summarized in the following table:
|        | |                        |   |
|-------------------------|--------|-------------------|------------------|
| Adjustment interval (s) | $\tau$ | Averaging param.| $n$/$t$/$\omega$ |
| Est. capacity multiplier | $m$    | min, max Bitrate  | $B_{\min}$, $B_{\max}$ |
| VF-RTT thresh. (ms)     | $\sigma$ | initial Bitrate   | $B_{\text{init}}$  |
| NFR thresh.             | $\rho$ | Bitrate steps count | $N_{\text{s}}$ |
| VF-RTT adj. prob.       | $\gamma_{\text{rtt}}$ | Bitrate inc. steps | $N_{\text{up}}$ |
| Bitrate inc. explor. prob. | $\gamma_{\text{+}}$ | Bitrate dec. steps | $N_{\text{dw}}$ |
|        | |                        |   |

Our parameter recommendations are outlined in the following table:

|        | |                        |   | |                        |
|--------|------|-----------|-----|---------|------|
| $\tau$ | 1    | $\sigma$  | 22  | $\rho$  | 0.99 |
| $t$    | 1    | $\gamma_{\text{rtt}}$ | 1   | $\gamma_{\text{+}}$ | 0.25 |
| $m$    | 0.9  | $N_{\text{s}}$ | 9   | $N_{\text{up}}$ | 1   |
|        | |                        |   | |                        |
 
Note that parameters such as $B_{\text{min}}, B_{\text{max}}, B_{\text{init}}$ depend on the quality requirements of the target application.

Our predefined profiles include the *Balanced* profile (consistent increase and decrease adjustments: $N_{\text{dw}} = N_{\text{up}}$), the *Speedy* profile (faster bitrate reductions: $N_{\text{dw}} = 2N_{\text{up}}$), and the *Anxious* profile (bitrate drops to the minimum: $N_{\text{dw}} = N_{\text{s}}$). These profiles integrate our parameter recommendations and can be selected based on the desired responsiveness to network fluctuations

An `HeuristicStats` event is logged in the `session_log.txt` file at each NeSt-VR adjustment period. This event includes several decision-making process-related statistics for that period, such as the considered bitrate step size $\Delta B$ (`bitrate_step_size_bps`), sampled values from uniform distributions for bitrate increase probability $r_+$ (`r_inc`) and VF-RTT adjustment probability $r_{\text{rtt}}$ (`r_rtt`), the computed average frame delivery rate $fps_{rx}$ (`fps_rx_avg`) and average frame transmission rate $fps_{tx}$ (`fps_tx_avg`), the computed average NFR (`nfr_avg`), the computed average VF-RTT (`rtt_avg_ms`), and the requested bitrate $B_k$ (`requested_bitrate_bps`), among others.
